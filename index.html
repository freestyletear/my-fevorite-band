        Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak met in 2017 while touring together on the
        European leg of Mars' 24K Magic World Tour (2017–18). The two were seen
        in the studio working with Nile Rodgers and Guy Lawrence of Disclosure.
        They quickly became friends and decided to collaborate on a project
        together. In an interview with New Zealand radio DJ Zane Lowe for the
        Apple Music radio station Apple Music 1, Mars said that most of the
        album is "rooted in [Paak's] drum beats". He continued, saying that he
        works "backward from the guitar or piano", whereas Paak's "music is
        percussion-driven, derived from old-school Motown influence." They
        credit each other for the "newfangled soundscape" that models Silk
        Sonic's sound. While in the studio, Mars and Paak tried to create a
        dream setlist. They dubbed it as "the setlist of doom", however they
        needed someone who could "thread" all the songs. Mars admitted that both
        he and Paak admired Bootsy Collins, who, ultimately, hosted the album.
        Collins came up with the name for Mars and Paak's duo. According to
        Mars, studio sessions started in 2017 due to a phrase he came up during
        the tour that ended up on the hook of one of the songs on the album.
        Afterwards, the duo decided to keep creating more music, and despite the
        COVID-19 pandemic, Paak affirmed that instead of "trying to make music
        long-distance", both of them got "in the studio face-to-face". This
        allowed the duo to jam out, understand how to make people feel good with
        the songs they created from scratch and what was missing on the tracks.
        Mars declared, "Anderson coming into the studio and unlocking something
        in my brain that I've never used before...That's how inspiration
        happens, you know?" On February 26, 2021, Mars and Paak announced they
        have recorded an album together under the band name Silk Sonic. At the
        time, the band's debut album was set to be titled An Evening with Silk
        Sonic and features American musician Bootsy Collins as a special guest
        host. At the same time, the artwork was revealed and is a "retro sketch
        of the two hitmakers' floating heads that reads, "An evening with Silk
        Sonic ... with special guest host Bootsy Collins". They also announced
        the release of the first single on March 5, 2021. On the latter date,
        the album title was confirmed.
